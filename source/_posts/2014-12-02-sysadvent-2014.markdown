[SysAdvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/) is a set of articles on system administration topics written by practicing sysadmins. Now in its 7th year of posting an article for each day of December ending on the 25th it continues to provide insightful and useful articles that I eagerly anticipate each year.

This post will provide a resource list with links to each of the articles and links to the contributors [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) feeds too.
