Last month I attended the [AgileNZ 2014](http://agilenz.co.nz/) Conference in Wellington. Sponsored by [Assurity](http://assurity.co.nz/) the conference boasted an impressive line up of talented speakers, both national and international. Seeing [Gojko Adzic](http://gojko.net/) (Author of [Specification By Example](http://specificationbyexample.com/)) and [Tobias Mayer](http://businesscraftsmanship.com/) (Author of ([The People's Scrum](http://www.amazon.com/The-Peoples-Scrum-Revolutionary-Transformation/dp/1937965155/)) present in NZ reflected the conference organisers credibility amongst the Agile Community. 

Day 1 saw me attend the opening presentation by Conference Chair, [__Edwin Dando__](http://agileforeveryone.com/) followed by __Gojko Adzic__'s _Specification by Example_ keynote. I also attended talks by a former colleague [__Dispesh Pala__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipeshpala) (now IBM), [__Bernard O'Leary__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardoleary), [__Clare McLennan__](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/clare-mclennan/3/b81/48) and [__Martin Kearns__](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2656102) as well as [__Eric Willeke__](http://ericwilleke.com/)'s afternoon keynote. The programme for the conference listing all the speakers can be found [here](http://agilenz.co.nz/programme/).
