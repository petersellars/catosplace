I sense that Ansible is growing in popularity. ThoughtWorks now recommends the adoption of Ansible '*for automated control of your infrastructure*' in their industry recognised Technologoy Radar.

>we continue to be impressed with its capabilities and ease of use compared to other offerings in this space

*ThoughtWorks Technology Radar - July 2014*

I have been researching and experimenting with Docker for a while, but have yet to really decide on a best way to manage it. Whilst looking into Ansible I was intrigued by their claim that:

> __Ansible is the best way to manage Docker__

*Ansible Website - Ansible & Docker*

There is a video from Ansiblefest NYC May 2014 on the Ansible &amp; Docker page outlining a number of Ansible modules that support Docker management. Among them are the *docker_module*, *docker_images_module*, *docker_facts_module* and a *docker inventory plugin*.

|Module Name|Docker Use|Project Link| 
|--------------|----------|------------|
|docker_images_module|Add, Build or Remove Docker Images||
|docker_module||
|docker_facts||
|docker plugin||
